# Analysis Pipeline

The AX POC analysis pipeline transforms raw engineering drawings into structured manufacturing data through a series of specialized ML stages.

## Pipeline Overview

<PipelineDiagram type="main" />

## Pipeline Stages

Each stage is implemented as an independent microservice, allowing horizontal scaling and independent deployment.

| Stage | Service | Port | Description | Sub-page |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Classification** | VL (Qwen2-VL) | 5004 | Drawing type classification (mechanical, P&ID, table, text, photo) | [VLM Classification](./vlm-classification.md) |
| **2. Detection** | YOLO v11 | 5005 | Symbol and component detection with 73 classes | [YOLO Detection](./yolo-detection.md) |
| **3. OCR** | eDOCr2 + 7 engines | 5002-5015 | Dimension, text, and GD&T extraction | [OCR Processing](./ocr-processing.md) |
| **4. Tolerance** | SkinModel Shapes | 5003 | GD&T tolerance analysis and stack-up | [Tolerance Analysis](./tolerance-analysis.md) |
| **5. Revision** | Gateway API | 8000 | Side-by-side revision comparison and delta tracking | [Revision Comparison](./revision-comparison.md) |

## Key Characteristics

- **Microservice Architecture**: Each ML model runs in its own Docker container with independent GPU allocation.
- **Gateway Orchestration**: The Gateway API (port 8000) coordinates all service calls and aggregates results.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Agent verification at critical stages ensures accuracy before final output.
- **Ensemble Methods**: OCR uses 4-engine weighted voting for maximum accuracy.
- **DAG Execution**: BlueprintFlow enables custom pipeline composition via visual workflow builder.
