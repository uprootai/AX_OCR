# Agent Verification

The Agent Verification system ensures quality assurance for ML-based detection results through a 3-level hybrid approach that balances automation efficiency with human oversight.

## Problem

ML-based object detection and OCR extraction produce results with varying confidence levels. High-confidence detections are generally accurate, but borderline and low-confidence results require review. Manual verification of every detection is impractical at scale -- a single engineering drawing can produce 50+ detections and 100+ dimension extractions.

## Solution: 3-Level Hybrid Verification

The system routes each detection through one of three verification levels based on confidence score and contextual signals, achieving an optimal balance between speed and accuracy.

| Level | Name | Confidence Range | Handler | Typical Volume |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| **L1** | Auto-Approve | >= 0.9 | System | ~60-70% of items |
| **L2** | Agent Review | 0.7 - 0.9 | Claude Sonnet (Vision) | ~20-25% of items |
| **L3** | Human Review | < 0.7 | Human operator | ~5-15% of items |

Combined, over 80% of items are processed without human intervention, while maintaining high accuracy through AI agent review of borderline cases.

## Key Features

- **Priority-based Queue**: Critical (low confidence) items surface first for review
- **Active Learning**: All verification decisions (approve/reject/modify) are logged for model retraining
- **Dual Item Types**: Supports both symbol detections and dimension extractions
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk approve high-confidence items in one click
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjust auto-approve and critical thresholds per deployment
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time verification progress, agent vs human distribution, and accuracy metrics

## Architecture Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Active Learning Service** | Priority queue, threshold management, retraining data collection |
| **Verification Router** | Human verification UI endpoints (queue, verify, bulk-approve) |
| **Agent Verification Router** | LLM Agent-specific endpoints (base64 images, Playwright-friendly) |
| **Dashboard** | Real-time statistics, action distribution, confidence analysis |
